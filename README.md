#The Monkees website – First milestone project

This project is a frontend-only website built by using the technologies that I've learned throughout User Centric Frontend Development. 
The project is a static website for a 60's band "The Monkees". 
The purpose of the project is to implement my knowledge by creating a 4-5 pages responsive website. The project represents guidelines given by Code Institute and requirements from interviews with the client’s representatives.

##UX
The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world.   Requirements have been given after interviews with the client’s representatives. 
 (Primary target audiences: fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from the back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
The band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicize their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
On web site supposed to be presented: Photos of the band members, video and Audio clips.
As a part of social media presence  - links to the band's Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.
My goal was to represent all of these requirements in the project.
 I used 5 planes of UX design: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, and Surface. )
The main target auditory going to be old fans of the band.  Who is into the music and style of the '60s '70s. But the target is also to attract new fans. So the target to combine style and technology which fit for a wide range of auditory.
Navigation supposed to be easily understandable and content could be followed in an intuitive way.
By monitoring social pages where you can find photos of the band or their music and reading comments from their fans, becoming an obvious high level of interest to any new information about the band. Also, interest to see their new performances. 
The website gives an opportunity to contact the band in request of hiring them as well as following updates about concerts and receiving bands newsletters. 
As well as the possibility to listen to music, watch videos and enter more opportunities to stay in touch with a band and their fans, around the world,  by following social links.
